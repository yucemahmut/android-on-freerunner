## Introduction ##


This page is under the major construction.
Please refer to a Deviant Art page for this project
**[Android on FreeRunner, art](http://androidonfreerunner.deviantart.com/)
for some graphics. The reason why DeviantArt was used as a graphics storage was to attract the viewers and possible artists who would like to contribute to this project.**

Currently, there are 4 categories used on a Deviant Art page
-Blueprints
-Finals
-WallPapers
-Misc

**Blueprints are the rough ideas and drawings that someone may like to use and enhance with the textures and so on. All blueprints are 3 color blueprints, having the Android's logo colors:**

(blue) R:48 G:88 B:124
(green) R:151 G:192 B:61
(white) R:255 G:255 B:255

**Finals are the blueprints turned into a final image, with textures, shadows, and so on** WallPapers are the wallpapers that users may use for their mobile devices
**Misc (self-explanatory)**




TO DO:
-work on this page
-find the most proper resolution for the wallpapers (it should be 640:420)
-find/test the frequency distribution of the freerunner speakers for the ringtones.
